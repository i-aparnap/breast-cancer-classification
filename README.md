# breast-cancer-classification
This project uses the breast cancer dataset from sklearn to train and compare multiple classification algorithms.

##  Dataset
- Source: `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`
- Task: Classify tumors as benign or malignant

##  Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

## Accuracy Results
| Model                | Accuracy |
|---------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 97.37%   |
| SVM                 | 97.37%   |
| Random Forest       | 96.49%   |
| Decision Tree       | 94.74%   |
| k-NN                | 94.74%   |

## Conclusion
- Logistic Regression and SVM performed the best.
- All models gave reliable results.
- The dataset is well-structured and clean.
